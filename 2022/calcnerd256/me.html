    <p>
      If you are seeing this and you know how,
      then I want you to clone
      <a href="https://github.com/calcnerd256/pubweb">this website's repository on GitHub</a>,
      make your own namespace like mine,
      publish something,
      and send me a pull request.
      I might not like what you send me,
      and I might not re-publish it,
      but I want you to try.
    </p>
    <h2>to do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>describe myself</li>
      <li>describe this place</li>
      <li>decide what the conventions here should be</li>
    </ul>
